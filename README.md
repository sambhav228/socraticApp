Problem statement shared by Blume Ventures

####### To develop a Gen AI-powered teaching assistant that uses the Socratic method to teach students about Data Structures and Algorithms, specifically focusing on Sorting Algorithms, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the Scope: Narrow 

down the topic to Sorting Algorithms, which includes algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

2. Create a Question Bank: Develop a comprehensive set of probing questions that guide the student through understanding and solving problems related to sorting algorithms.

3. Implement a Decision 
        Tree: Use a decision tree to determine the next question based on the student's previous answers. 

4. Develop the AI Model: 
    Train an AI model to understand the student's responses and navigate the decision tree accordingly.

5. User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface where students can interact with the AI assistant.


Pseudocode for the AI Assistant

1. Initialize the System:

Load the question bank.

Initialize the decision tree.

I

2. Start the Session:

Greet the student and ask the initial question.

3. Process Student's Response:

Analyze the student's response.

Navigate the decision tree to determine the next question.

Ask the next question.

4. Loop Until Learning Objective is Met:

Continue the question-response loop until the student demonstrates understanding.

5. Provide Feedback:

Offer feedback based on the student's performance.

To implement logic to check 

if the response is correct, we need to compare the student's response with the expected answer. For simplicity, let's assume we have a predefined set of correct answers for each question. We can then compare the student's response to these correct answers.

Here is an updated version of the JavaScript code that 

includes the logic to check if the response is correct:

Explanation

Question Bank: The questionBank object contains the questions and the next question IDs based on whether the response is correct or incorrect.

Decision Tree: The decisionTree object maps 

each question ID to its corresponding question and the next question IDs.

SocraticAssistant Class: This class manages the flow of questions and responses.

askQuestion(): Displays the current question.

processResponse (response): Processes the student's response and 

determines the next question based on whether the response is correct. checkResponse(response, questionId): Checks if the response is correct by comparing it to a predefined set of acceptable answers. This implementation provides a basic framework for a Socratic teaching assistant that checks the correctness of the student's responses


HTML: The HTML code provides a simple interface for the student to interact with the assistant.

and guides them through the learning process.

This implementation provides a basic framework for a Socratic teaching assistant focused on sorting algorithms. The assistant 

asks questions, processes responses, and guides the student through the learning process using a decision tree. The user interface allows students to interact with the assistant by submitting their answers.
