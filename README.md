### Problem statement shared by Blume Ventures
_________________________________________
Develop a Gen AI powered tool to make a teaching assistant to teach a student using the Socratic teaching method. The Socratic method is where the assistant asks probing questions and leads the student to the answer instead of revealing the answer. Given this is a hard problem, we want to restrict it to one particular topic viz. Learning of Data Structures and Algorithms. Feel free to narrow it down even further if it helps make a high-quality assistant e.g. only for Algorithms of Sorting. That is a topic that should be familiar to most software engineers working on this. As an example, if a test-case times out, the assistant shouldn’t just say: “It timed out because it was a large input size”. It should first pick the right question to ask the student e.g. “What can you say about the difference between this test-case and the other test-cases that passed?” Then depending on what answer the student gives, ask the next relevant question, eventually making the student see that this test-case is quite large and some particular section of their code timed out processing that size. Hence that section needs to be optimized. Several studies have shown that the Socratic method of teaching is very effective for learning, but it is very challenging to scale for any commercial viability anywhere in education, because of a. limited supply of effective teachers who can do this and b. it is not very effective in 1xMany teaching, needing it to be 1x1. AI assistants have the potential to overcome both of these challenges.

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
  To develop a Gen AI-powered teaching assistant that uses the Socratic method to teach students about Data Structures and Algorithms, specifically focusing on Sorting Algorithms, we can   follow these steps:

  1. Define the Scope:
     Narrow down the topic to Sorting Algorithms, which includes algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

2. Create a Question Bank:
   Develop a comprehensive set of probing questions that guide the student through understanding and solving problems related to sorting algorithms.

4. Implement a Decision 
        Tree: Use a decision tree to determine the next question based on the student's previous answers. 

5. Develop the AI Model: 
    Train an AI model to understand the student's responses and navigate the decision tree accordingly.

6. User Interface:
   Create a user-friendly interface where students can interact with the AI assistant.

<b>Pseudocode for the AI Assistant</b>

1. Initialize the System:

    Load the question bank.

    Initialize the decision tree.

2. Start the Session:

    Greet the student and ask the initial question.

3. Process Student's Response:

    Analyze the student's response.

    Navigate the decision tree to determine the next question.

    Ask the next question.

4. Loop Until Learning Objective is Met:

    Continue the question-response loop until the student demonstrates understanding.

5. Provide Feedback:

    Offer feedback based on the student's performance.

<br/>
<b>Explanation</b>

Question Bank: The questionBank object contains the questions and the next question IDs based on whether the response is correct or incorrect.

Decision Tree: The decisionTree object maps 

each question ID to its corresponding question and the next question IDs.

SocraticAssistant Class: This class manages the flow of questions and responses.

askQuestion(): Displays the current question.

processResponse (response): Processes the student's response and determines the next question based on whether the response is correct. 

checkResponse(response, questionId): Checks if the response is correct by comparing it to a predefined set of acceptable answers. 

<br/>
This implementation provides a basic framework for a Socratic teaching assistant that checks the correctness of the student's responses and guides them through the learning process.

This implementation provides a basic framework for a Socratic teaching assistant focused on sorting algorithms. The assistant asks questions, processes responses, and guides the student through the learning process using a decision tree. The user interface allows students to interact with the assistant by submitting their answers.
